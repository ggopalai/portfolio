                        <p>Howdy, thanks for visiting my website.</p>
                        <p>I am a graduate student at UCSD, pursuing my Masters in Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on Computer Systems. 
                            More specifically, I am interested in the areas of Cloud Computing, Distributed Systems and Networking. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Prior to UCSD, I spent about 3 years with Cisco as a Software Engineer.</p>
                        <p>I got my bachelors degree from R.V College of Enginering in Bangalore.</p>

                    <h2> Industry Experience</h2>
                    
                    <p> Before joining UCSD, I had the opportunity to work as a Software Engineer at Cisco Systems, where I gained valuable industry experience. During my 3-year tenure at Cisco, I was primarily involved in the development of the Cisco CX Cloud, a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering catering to a diverse range of Cisco customers.
                    In the initial phase of my role, I dedicated 8 months to the Optimal Software Version Recommendation team, where I was responsible for developing microservices using Java. This experience allowed me to strengthen my Java programming skills and deepen my understanding of building scalable and efficient software solutions. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p> Following that, I transitioned to the Business Critical Services team for a brief period, where I gained exposure to critical business operations and had the opportunity to work on projects with high impact. This experience honed my ability to tackle complex challenges and effectively collaborate with cross-functional teams.
                    The major portion of my time at Cisco was dedicated to building an Authentication framework for the CX Cloud. This project required me to work closely with the security team and utilize industry best practices to design and implement a robust and secure authentication system. Through this endeavor, I enhanced my knowledge of authentication protocols, security frameworks, and user management systems. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p> My experience at Cisco Systems has equipped me with a strong foundation in software engineering principles, agile development methodologies, and collaborative teamwork. It has also provided me with exposure to working in a large-scale enterprise environment and handling the complexities associated with delivering high-quality software solutions.
                    I am excited to bring the skills and expertise gained from my previous experiences to contribute to new and challenging projects, leveraging my technical acumen and problem-solving abilities to drive innovation and deliver impactful solutions.

                    <h2>Research Experience</h2>
                    <p>I have the privilege of working in the Carbonless Cloud Computing lab on an exciting project called GreenGrader. Our team is dedicated to developing a platform that facilitates carbon-aware scheduling of autograder containers on various cloud computing platforms.
                       The primary focus of our work is to address the environmental impact associated with cloud computing. By integrating carbon-aware scheduling techniques into our platform, we aim to optimize the allocation of computing resources while minimizing carbon emissions. This involves considering factors such as renewable energy availability, server utilization, and energy efficiency when scheduling autograder containers.
                       Our goal is to provide a sustainable solution for the autograding process, enabling educational institutions and organizations to efficiently utilize cloud resources while reducing their carbon footprint. By leveraging the power of cloud computing in an environmentally conscious manner, we aim to contribute to a more sustainable future.
